- bug with str(get_tx())[2:-1] in deploy_token.py:57
- make the difference between Coin-Transactions and Contract-call-Transactions clearer
- feedback was:
  - nice
  - too easy
  - buggy (outch, shame on me)
- if we mark something for Hard-Coder, it is probably sufficciant to have just "for programmers" stuff.
